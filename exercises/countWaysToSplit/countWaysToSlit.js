// You are given a string s. Your task is to count the number of ways of splitting s into three non-empty parts a, b and c (s = a + b + c) in such a way that a + b, b + c and c + a are all different strings.

// NOTE: + refers to string concatenation.

// Example

// For s = "xzxzx", the output should be countWaysToSplit(s) = 5.

// Consider all the ways to split s into three non-empty parts:

// If a = "x", b = "z" and c = "xzx", then all a + b = "xz", b + c = "zxzx" and c + a = xzxx are different.
// If a = "x", b = "zx" and c = "zx", then all a + b = "xzx", b + c = "zxzx" and c + a = zxx are different.
// If a = "x", b = "zxz" and c = "x", then all a + b = "xzxz", b + c = "zxzx" and c + a = xx are different.
// If a = "xz", b = "x" and c = "zx", then a + b = b + c = "xzx". Hence, this split is not counted.
// If a = "xz", b = "xz" and c = "x", then all a + b = "xzxz", b + c = "xzx" and c + a = xxz are different.
// If a = "xzx", b = "z" and c = "x", then all a + b = "xzxz", b + c = "zx" and c + a = xxzx are different.
// Since there are five valid ways to split s, the answer is 5.
